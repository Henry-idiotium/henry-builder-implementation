# henry-builder-implementation
A Academic management system with no good UI whatsoever (using console only without any configuration). The system is built with the intention of intergating the *Builder design pattern* for learning purposes. 

Currently, this system only consists of two entities, including Student and Lecturer; however, to adding more entity (or diffent type of entity), then the process just create new ***enum query*** or new type of ***builder interface (if it is a diffent type of entity)***.
